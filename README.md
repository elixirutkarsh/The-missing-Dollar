# The-missing-Dollar
Three friends go to a restaurant and order food. The total bill comes to $30. They decide to split the bill equally, so each friend contributes $10. The waiter realizes that there is a special discount for that day, and the bill is only $25. The waiter gives $5 back to the friends. They decide to return $1 to each friend and keep $2 as a tip for the waiter. Now, each friend has paid $9 (totaling $27) and the $2 tip makes it $29. But the total paid was $30. What happened to the missing dollar?

Solution:
This puzzle often confuses people due to the way it's presented. The trick lies in understanding how the amount is calculated.

Let's track the money:

Initial total bill: $30
Money returned to friends: $5
Money returned to each friend: $1 x 3 = $3
Money kept as a tip: $2
Now, if we add the money returned to each friend and the tip, it will be $3 + $2 = $5.

So, the total money spent by the friends is $30 (initial bill) - $5 (returned money) + $5 (returned money to friends and tip) = $30.

There is no missing dollar. The initial total bill is accounted for, and there is no discrepancy in the calculations. The puzzle is designed to confuse by mixing up the money movements and creating a misleading narrative.
